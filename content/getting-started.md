# Getting Started

Generative AI 


## You

This book is for anyone who wants to learn how to use generative AI and Large Language Models (LLMs) without subscribing to a service. While many genAI chats are free, but you can do so much more with LLMs 

## Docker

Generative AI models and software are released weekly. They tend to favor Unix flavored operating systems such as Linux and macOS. If you use Windows, you maybe not be able to run the latest versions. Docker containers can get around operating system requirements by wrapping all the supporting software into a single package and running it in the Docker engine.

I highly recommend using Docker and containers to simplify software updates and to run large language model. Download and install Docker Desktop from this link

## Chocolatey

Chocolatey is a Windows package manager that lets you install software. Many generative AI examples use unix utilities and you can download and install Windows equivalents

## Python

Many of the hacks use Python and Python packages. Install the latest version for your operating system.
